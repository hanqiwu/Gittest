Name  EPS Mobility Management
Entity  - Flexi NS - MME ID (c-number)
- tracking area identity (TAI)
-   - public land mobile network (PLMN)
-     - mobile country code (MCC)
-     - mobile network code (MNC)
-   - tracking area code (TAC)

The EPS Mobility Management measurement provides information on, for example, successful
  and failed EPS attaches and detaches, tracking area updates, service requests, handovers
  and paging procedures. The mobility management functions are used to keep track
  of the current location of a user equipment (UE) within the public land mobile network
  (PLMN) or within another PLMN.

  The counters are collected on the tracking area level.
